For shortes paths you need a length in the rooms
So start->len = 0; else->len = (-1 or INTMAX)

start->prev needs to be NULL for path translation (prev etc into char **).

when testing later, try adding a bunch of extra (invalid) ##commands everywhere

lldb
settings set target.input-path ../testfiles/pdfexample1.txt
