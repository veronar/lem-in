### **Description**

Some students of the School of Wizardry have created Hex, a thinking machine. It is composed of ants for calculus, bee-hives and bees for memory and a mouse for (.. Huh, right, what for already?) cheese (to feed the mouse) and a feather for writing.  
We are going to look in depth at its calculus bit. How does it work? Simple! We make an ant farm, with tunnels and rooms; we place the ants on one side; and we look at how they find the exit.  
How do we build an ant farm? We need tubes and rooms  
We join the rooms to one another with as many tubes as we need. A tube joins two rooms to each other. No more than that. A room can be linked to an infinite number of rooms and by as many tubes as deemed necessary. Then we must bury the ant farm (wherever you want). This is extremely important to ensure that ants don’t cheat and look at your design before before the game starts.  
Because arts and crafts with boxes, tape and ropes are not our greatest strength, we will create a digital version instead.  
The goal of this project is to create an “Hex” simulator.
